## Features 🚀

- **Define a Universal Set**: Create a universal set with user-defined elements.
- **Membership Verification**: Check if an element belongs to a set.
- **Subset Classification**: Automatically classify a set as a proper subset, or not a subset.
subset, or not subset.
- **Power Set Generation**: Generate the power set of a given set.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Define the Universal Set**:

- Specify the number of elements in the universal set.
- Add elements to the universal set.

2. **Verify Membership**:

- The program checks if each element belongs to the universal set.

3. **Classify Subsets**:

- Subsets are classified as proper, improper, or not subsets.

4. **Power Set Generation**:

- The power set of the universal set is generated.
